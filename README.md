# Document-grounded Generation Search for URA's DC Guidelines

Try the demo here: 
*To be updated*

## Background

The motivation for this bot is that searching for information on the Development Control (DC) guidelines website can be intimidating due to the large amount of information on the website. This is where a Q&A bot like this one can come in to provide users with an efficient way of getting the information they need about the DC guidelines.

The technology behind the bot is Document Grounded generation. [Document Grounded Generation](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2021/06/25/document-grounded-generation/) was first posited by [Shrimai Prabhumoye](https://shrimai.github.io/) at CMU ML, as a method for grounding Generative AI output with context documents.

## Deploy

Deploy this starter to Vercel. The Supabase integration will automatically set the required environment variables and configure your [Database Schema](./supabase/migrations/20230406025118_init.sql). All you have to do is set your `OPENAI_KEY` and you're ready to go!

## Technical Details

Building your own custom Document Grounded Generation involves four steps:

1. [👷 Build time] Pre-process the knowledge base (your `.mdx` files in your `pages` folder).
2. [👷 Build time] Store embeddings in Postgres with [pgvector](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector).
3. [🏃 Runtime] Perform vector similarity search to find the content that's relevant to the question.
4. [🏃 Runtime] Inject content into OpenAI GPT-3 text completion prompt and stream response to the client.

## 👷 Build time

Step 1. and 2. happen at build time, e.g. when Vercel builds your Next.js app. During this time the [`generate-embeddings`](./lib/generate-embeddings.ts) script is being executed which performs the following tasks:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Vercel
    participant DB (pgvector)
    participant OpenAI (API)
    loop 1. Pre-process the knowledge base
        Vercel->>Vercel: Chunk .mdx pages into sections
        loop 2. Create & store embeddings
            Vercel->>OpenAI (API): create embedding for page section
            OpenAI (API)->>Vercel: embedding vector(1536)
            Vercel->>DB (pgvector): store embedding for page section
        end
    end
```

In addition to storing the embeddings, this script generates a checksum for each of your `.mdx` files and stores this in another database table to make sure the embeddings are only regenerated when the file has changed.

## 🏃 Runtime

Step 3. and 4. happen at runtime, anytime the user submits a question. When this happens, the following sequence of tasks is performed:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Edge Function
    participant DB (pgvector)
    participant OpenAI (API)
    Client->>Edge Function: { query: lorem ispum }
    critical 3. Perform vector similarity search
        Edge Function->>OpenAI (API): create embedding for query
        OpenAI (API)->>Edge Function: embedding vector(1536)
        Edge Function->>DB (pgvector): vector similarity search
        DB (pgvector)->>Edge Function: relevant docs content
    end
    critical 4. Inject content into prompt
        Edge Function->>OpenAI (API): completion request prompt: query + relevant docs content
        OpenAI (API)-->>Client: text/event-stream: completions response
    end
```

The relevant files for this are the [`SearchDialog` (Client)](./components/SearchDialog.tsx) component and the [`vector-search` (Edge Function)](./pages/api/vector-search.ts).

The initialization of the database, including the setup of the `pgvector` extension is stored in the [`supabase/migrations` folder](./supabase/migrations/) which is automatically applied to your local Postgres instance when running `supabase start`.

## Local Development

### Configuration

- `cp .env.example .env`
- Set your `OPENAI_KEY` in the newly created `.env` file.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` run:
> Note: You have to run supabase to retrieve the keys.

### Start Supabase

Make sure you have Docker installed and running locally. The follow the steps on: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker

Then run

```bash
supabase start
```

To retrieve `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` run:

```bash
supabase status
```

### Start the Next.js App

In a new terminal window, run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Using your custom .mdx docs
1. By default your documentation will need to be in `.mdx` format. This can be done by renaming existing (or compatible) markdown `.md` file.
2. Run `pnpm run embeddings` to regenerate embeddings.
    > Note: Make sure supabase is running. To check, run `supabase status`. If is not running run `supabase start`.
3. Run `pnpm dev` again to refresh NextJS localhost:3000 rendered page.
