## Mr Kenneth Er, Deputy Secretary (Planning) at MND

Mr Kenneth Er (余文辉) is currently the Deputy Secretary (Planning), Ministry of National Development from 1 Jun 2023. He was the former CEO of NParks.


Mr Kenneth Er graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Forestry), first class honours,
from the Australian National University in 1996. He pursued a postgraduate programme
at the University of British Columbia and graduated with a Master of Science in 2002.


Mr Er was appointed as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), NParks on 17 Feb 2014.
Prior to this, he held various key positions, including Chief Operating Officer of Gardens
by the Bay Co. (GB) from Apr 2012 to Feb 2014, and Assistant CEO (Corporate
Development & Services Cluster) of NParks from Apr 2010 to Apr 2012, while concurrently
holding the position of GB’s General Manager from Feb 2007 to Nov 2011. Mr Er led the
project and development team that conceptualised, developed and operationalised
Gardens by the Bay. He had project management and financial oversight of the
development, and brought together the latest technologies on sustainable energy and
water resources into the design and running of the conservatories and gardens.

As CEO of NParks, Mr Er played a key role in the conceptualisation of the City in
Nature vision, and led the NParks team to realise the vision by conserving and extending
Singapore’s natural capital island-wide. He drove the establishment of Nature Park
Networks to buffer Singapore’s nature reserves from surrounding urban development,
expand habitats for biodiversity, as well as provide compatible nature-based recreation
options. He also directed the naturalisation of gardens and parks, and intensification of
habitat enhancement and species recovery efforts. As part of the effort to connect green
spaces and provide more recreational options despite Singapore’s limited land, Mr Er
pushed for new island-wide connections, such as the Round Island Route and Coast-toCoast Trails. He also proposed a study to develop a more comprehensive picture of
Singapore’s island-wide ecosystem and ecological connectivity, the Ecological Profiling
Exercise, to guide urban planners to sensitively integrate nature in our urban landscape
upfront in our land use plans while balancing between our various land use needs.

During his time as CEO, Mr Er oversaw several major milestones and projects for
Singapore’s parks and gardens as well. The Singapore Botanic Gardens was inscribed
as Singapore’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Tyersall-Gallop Core was
completed. Mr Er was also a key figure in the conceptualisation and implementation of
plans to enhance Fort Canning Park, Jurong Lake Gardens and Admiralty Park. Mr Er
rejuvenated East Coast Park, Singapore’s largest and most popular park, and expanded
park programming for people of all ages.

With Mr Er’s emphasis on taking a science-based approach and the use of
technology, NParks has integrated technology into park and greenery management
operations and biodiversity conservation efforts, and distinguished itself as a leader in
arboriculture, horticulture and nature conservation. Digitalisation initiatives employed
include diagnostic analysis, modelling, sensors and monitoring systems. In 2019, with the
transfer of animal-related functions to NParks, Mr Er drove the adoption of a communityand science-based approach towards wildlife and animal management. He galvanised the
new Animal & Veterinary Service cluster to strengthen capacities and enhance
competencies in animal health and welfare. Under Mr Er’s direction, NParks has also
strengthened its capabilities in combatting illegal wildlife trade by increasing penalties
under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, establishing the Centre for
Wildlife Forensics and forging partnerships with local and international agencies.

Mr Er believed strongly that community stewardship is crucial to the transformation
of Singapore into a City in Nature, and thus ensured the continued expansion of NParks’
range of programmes and initiatives over the years, such as the Community in Nature
initiative, Youth Stewards for Nature programme, Friends of the Parks initiative and the
OneMillionTrees movement. As a result, NParks’ volunteer base has grown to over 60,000
today.

## Ms Hwang Yu-Ning (CEO of NParks)

Ms Hwang Yu-Ning is the current CEO of Nparks. She was the former Chief Planner of URA.

Ms Hwang Yu-Ning graduated from the National University of Singapore with a
Bachelor of Architecture (Hons) in 1994. She subsequently obtained a Master in Public
Policy (Urban Planning) from Harvard University in 2001. She has served in Singapore’s
public service as an urban planner and policy maker for close to 30 years, including at the
Strategy Group of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of National Development.

Ms Hwang was instrumental in leading the development and implementation of
planning strategies across Singapore. She led URA through the recently concluded LongTerm Plan Review (LTPR), a national exercise to map out the strategic land uses and
infrastructure needs of Singapore over the next 50 years and beyond. Under her
leadership, URA conducted an extensive engagement, with more than 15,000 people from
all walks of life sharing their hopes and aspirations for Singapore in over 50 engagement
sessions across various platforms. As a result, URA formulated land use and
infrastructure strategies in the LTPR that not only ensure the optimal use of our limited
land to cater for future opportunities and unforeseen needs, but also took into account the
needs and aspirations of current and future generations.

Ms Hwang also steered the review of the Draft Master Plan 2019 (DMP19), which
set out detailed plans and policies for Singapore’s development over 10 to 15 years, as
well as the coordination of physical and social infrastructure across Singapore. Similarly,
URA consulted and engaged diverse stakeholders in the DMP19 review, particularly at
the localised levels. Ms Hwang oversaw the formulation of strategy and managed land
use and physical development plans, working closely with the public and private sectors
to realise the planning vision. Key proposals unveiled under DMP19 included strategies
that focused on planning sustainable, green and inclusive neighbourhoods, rejuvenation
of neighbourhoods and creating capacity for our future.

Under Ms Hwang’s leadership, URA’s conservation programme and efforts to
enhance the integration of built heritage into our urban environment also reached new
heights. Notably, in addition to several newly-conserved buildings, URA conserved
Golden Mile Complex - the first large strata-titled development to be gazetted for
conservation and implemented the Heritage Impact Assessment Framework.

Ms Hwang strengthened URA’s smart planning efforts by driving the growth of
urban analytics capabilities and evidence-based urban planning in partnership with
government agencies and the industry. She provided strategic directions for URA to
leverage and integrate digital tools and data analytics in planning. URA has been
appointed as the Centre of Excellence for Urban Planning and Design Technology, which
promotes a more integrated planning approach through the sharing of data and platforms
across agencies, while levelling up competencies in integrated urban planning capabilities
and technology solutions.

Ms Hwang was part of Singapore’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,
mobilising various stakeholders to work closely with URA to identify sites to house foreign
workers. In addition, she worked with industry professionals to review the standards for
dormitories, with a view to provide safe accommodation for workers while optimising the
use of space and achieving cost efficiency.

Planning at URA, overseeing long-term land use planning for Singapore. In her 25 years

ensuring that our land use plans effectively incorporate environmental considerations,
planning for an ageing population, to developing a master plan for Singapore’s
underground space.

Ms Tan also played a leading role in URA’s Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR). She
led her team in identifying and studying future trends and challenges to conceptualise the
relevant land use strategies in the LTPR. She also directly managed the LTPR’s year-long
public engagement exercise, including consultations and dialogues with members of the
public, industry stakeholders and public agencies. As part of the engagement efforts, Ms
Tan and her team also brought the developed LTPR plans and strategies closer to
Singaporeans through public exhibitions held in various parts of Singapore.

Science in Engineering (Civil Engineering & Operations Research) in 1997. She
subsequently obtained a Master in Public Administration from Harvard University in 2008.
