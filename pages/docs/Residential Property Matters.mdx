# Residential Property Matters

## I am doing a rennovation of an existing house which will have a new basement and swimming pool. Is this considered an A&A or a reconstruction?
It is considered A&A (Additional and Alteration works)

## If I am doing renovation works on a house and the existing roof overhangs are retained, can they can exempted from the site coverage as they were built under the old system?
No. The roof overhangs will have to be computed as site coverage.

## Can I enclose my balcony for strata landed property?
Balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. They cannot be converted into indoor spaces with full-height solid enclosures. For example, enclosing the balconies with fixed or sliding window panes such as 'Smart windows' is not allowed.
Nonetheless, to address concerns on safety and to provide some form of sun shading, we allow balcony screens provided they are fully retractable and allow for natural ventilation at all times, such as in the form of retractable louvered screens. You can also read more about the balcony enclosures guidelines. https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc13-01



## What is the maximum dwelling units (DUs) in a residential plot of land?

Except Central Area and selected areas, the maximum number of dwelling units is determined by dividing the MP permissible gross floor area by 85 sqm, and 100sqm for selected areas. The actual number of DUs that may be supported in any development shall be assessed based on the site context, existing site conditions and the impact on the local infrastructure. URA shall assess the overall layout, design and unit sizes of the residential development proposals, and may add other requirements where necessary to protect the quality of the living environment.

Each development shall provide a good mix of unit sizes with a minimum of 20% of Dus with nett internal area of at least 100sqm and maximum of 20% of DUs with nett internal area of 50sqm or less. As a guide, all self-contained DUs shall be at least 35sqm nett in internal area. Nett living spaces excludes voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges and other external areas.


## Guidelines on maximum allowable dwelling units in non-landed residential developments outside the Central Area

The maximum allowable number of DUs was derived from dividing the proposed building Gross Floor Area2 (GFA) by 85 square metres (sqm)3. Developers were also requested to provide a good mix of unit sizes and to have 20% or more of the DUs with a nett internal area4 of at least 100sqm and at most 20% of the DUs with a nett internal area of less than 50sqm. These earlier guidelines have been effective in achieving a good mix of both smaller and larger units in new private housing developments outside the Central Area.

As lifestyle needs evolve, the planning intention for the Central Area has shifted to position it as an attractive place to live, work and play. Hence, there have been concerted efforts to introduce more mixed uses in the Central Area to encourage more live-in population (including families) and make our city more vibrant. However, for developments within the Central Area, URA has observed a persistent trend in declining DU sizes. There is thus a need to ensure a good mix of DU sizes within the Central Area to support the planning intention.
Details of Guidelines

Taking the above into consideration, all new flats and condominiums within the Central Area, as well as the residential component of commercial and mixed-use developments, will be required to provide a minimum of 20% of DUs with a nett internal area of at least 70sqm.

The threshold of 70sqm is a reasonable size for small families, taking into account the tighter space constraints in the Central Area. URA has not imposed a cap on the total number of DUs within the Central Area because it is generally well-served by public transport, with residents here less reliant on private vehicles. As such, new developments are less likely to put a strain on local infrastructure.

Developers are encouraged to provide a good mix of DU sizes to cater to the diverse needs of all segments of the market, including larger families, and avoid a disproportionately large quantity of smaller DUs.

URA will continue to monitor and review the guidelines periodically, taking into account factors such as lifestyle changes and infrastructural developments.
Implementation

The guidelines will apply to relevant development applications submitted to URA on or after 18 January 2023. If the proposed development needs to undergo a Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS), applicants must first obtain LTA’s clearance6 before submitting the application.

Only formal development applications (excluding Outline Applications) which have already been granted Provisional Permission or which will result in a Provisional Permission that are submitted before 18 January 2023 will not be subject to the revised guidelines.
