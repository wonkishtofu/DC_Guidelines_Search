# Residential Property Matters

## I am doing a rennovation of an existing house which will have a new basement and swimming pool. Is this considered an A&A or a reconstruction?
It is considered A&A (Additional and Alteration works)

## If I am doing renovation works on a house and the existing roof overhangs are retained, can they can exempted from the site coverage as they were built under the old system?
No. The roof overhangs will have to be computed as site coverage.

## Can I enclose my balcony for strata landed property?
Balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. They cannot be converted into indoor spaces with full-height solid enclosures. For example, enclosing the balconies with fixed or sliding window panes such as 'Smart windows' is not allowed.
Nonetheless, to address concerns on safety and to provide some form of sun shading, we allow balcony screens provided they are fully retractable and allow for natural ventilation at all times, such as in the form of retractable louvered screens.
