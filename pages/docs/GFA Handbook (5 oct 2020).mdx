## INTRODUCTION

For development control purpose, Singapore uses a Gross Floor Area (GFA)
system to work out the bulk and intensity of a development. The Gross
Plot Ratio (GPR) for a specific development site is defined as the ratio
of the GFA of a building to its site or plot area^1^. The allowable GPR
of a development is guided by the GPR specified in the Master Plan (MP).

This GFA handbook explains which area or space of a development is
included or excluded from GFA for development control purpose. As a
general principle, all covered floor area of a development and all
uncovered area used for commercial purposes are included as GFA, unless
otherwise exempted. This is regardless of whether the spaces are
accessible or usable.

GFA is the total area of covered floor space measured between the centre
line of party walls, including the thickness of external walls but
excluding voids.

The area of a site/plot measured between the survey boundary lines. If
there are area(s) of the land required to be set aside for Drainage
Reserve or Street/Road Reserve to be vested to the State, these areas
may be included in the site area for GPR calculation. Once these areas
are vested to the State, they cannot be used for GPR calculation
subsequently.

## BONUS GROSS FLOOR AREA ABOVE MP ALLOWABLE INTENSITY

Bonus GFA is allowed over and above the MP GPR subject to a maximum of
10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the
additional GFA already used under the GFA incentive schemes shall not be
carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the
GPR specified in the prevailing MP.

Although a site may make use of multiple GFA incentive schemes, the
total GFA shall not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.
Developments are eligible for the following bonus GFA incentive schemes
if they comply with the relevant guidelines:

## GFA RELATED MATTERS

## GFA Apportionment

If the approved development comprises more than one use, the following
rules shall apply in the calculation of common areas. Such a mixed
development may also arise due to the land use zone, for example the
Commercial & Residential zone.

i.  ## Attributable space: Where a common area is exclusively used for
    a specific purpose, it will be apportioned to the specific use. See
 

 
 

ii. ## Non-attributable space: Where the common area is used for two or
    more purposes, it will be apportioned based on the weighted average,
    pegged to the prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning
    of the development. See example below.

 

The prescribed use quantum mix in the Master Plan zoning is detailed
below:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The new apportionment rules will be applied on a per floor basis. If a
floor is occupied by a single use (e.g. Commercial), any vertical
circulation GFA areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned
to Commercial use, though they may also be used by other users (e.g.
Residential) above for escape purposes. However, if the floor is
occupied by two or more uses^1^ for which the staircase GFA on that
floor cannot be exclusively attributed, they will be regarded as
non-attributable space and apportioned based on weighted average, pegged
to the prescribed use quantum in the Master Plan zoning.

The illustrations above are not exhaustive in covering all possible
building or layout designs. In evaluating the development applications,
URA may, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations
relevant to a case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration and check with URA through enquiries or development
applications to confirm the application of the rules on their proposals.

These should comprise actual uses and not common areas. For example, on
full Commercial floors with lift lobbies that serve Hotel uses, vertical
circulation areas like staircases on that floor will be apportioned to
Commercial use. However, on mixed floors with both Hotel and Shop uses,
vertical circulation areas will be apportioned based on weighted
average.

**GFA Apportionment for Sites with Specific Use Quantum Mix in Tender/
Lease Conditions**

For sites where the tender or lease conditions state that the land is to
be developed for a certain use quantum mix, non-attributable common
areas will be apportioned based on the specific use quantum mix stated
in the tender or lease conditions, rather than the Master Plan zoning.
For example, if the lease conditions for a site zoned Commercial require
that the site is to be developed for a use quantum mix of 65% Commercial
and 35% Civic & Community Institution, the non-attributable spaces will
be apportioned based on 65% Commercial and 35% Civic & Community
Institution, rather than 100% Commercial.

For White sites where the tender or lease conditions stipulate a minimum
quantum control on a particular use (e.g. minimum 30% Service
Apartment), this will be taken into account when apportioning the
non-attributable common areas with the balance 70% distributed to the
other uses in the development on a simple average basis. For example, if
the White site has a requirement of minimum 30% Service Apartment use
and the development also has Commercial and Hotel uses, the
apportionment of the non-attributable common areas will be based on 30%
Service Apartment, 35% Commercial and 35% Hotel.

In evaluating the development applications, URA may, if the
circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a
case so warrant, depart from these rules. Persons intending to carry out
a development are advised to take this into consideration and check with
URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm the
application of the rules on their proposals.

## Re-computation of GFA for Existing Developments

Prior to 1 Sep 1989, the intensity of residential developments was
determined using the population density (i.e. persons per hectare)
method while that for commercial developments was based on the nett
floor area method (i.e. excluding neutral areas). With effect from 1 Sep
1989, the different methods of determining development intensity for
different types of development were standardised by the current Gross
Floor Area (GFA) method. The GFA was re-defined by counting all covered
floor space within a development (unless specifically exempted) and
including open areas used for commercial purposes.\
\
To determine the intensity of such developments approved before 1 Sep
1989, there is a need to convert the approved GFA of the developments to
the standardised current GFA definition. For such developments, the
approved building would need to be recomputed based on the prevailing
GFA definition.

## Automated Teller Machine and Vending Machine Kiosks

Kiosk-type structures containing Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and
vending machines are included as GFA. Standalone ATMs and vending
machine are equipment and they are excluded from GFA.

## Balconies

Balconies are included as GFA.

 
 

*Balconies*

 

Under the Balcony Incentive Scheme (BIS), balconies may be included as
bonus GFA if they adhere to the BIS guidelines and submission
requirements stated in the Development Control Handbooks. Refer to the
links below for more information on the specific guidelines.

## Bicycle Parking Spaces and End-of-Trip Facilities

## Bicycle Parking Spaces

Bicycle parking spaces provided in accordance with LTA's prevailing
parking provision standards^1^ are excluded from GFA. Bicycle parking
spaces provided over and above LTA's minimum requirements may be
excluded from GFA if assessed by LTA and URA to be reasonable, given the
context of the development.

Such bicycle parking spaces shall be located at a convenient location
for cyclists, taking into consideration the alignment of adjacent
cycling paths/ shared paths, public transportation nodes and amenities.

^1^ Effective date: 8 May 2019. Refer to Circular No.:
URA/PB/2018/03-DCG (Annex A)

## End of Trip Facilities

Provision of End-of-Trip facilities listed in the table below may be
excluded from GFA.

URA shall consider whether the size of the facility is appropriate,
taking reference from LTA's guidelines on such facilities^1^. The
End-of-Trip facilities shall be located near the bicycle parking spaces
for the convenience of cyclists.

## Catwalks

Unenclosed metal perforated catwalk meant for maintenance purposes and
not exceeding 1.0m in width are excluded from GFA.

## Communal Roof Terrace

Open to sky communal roof terraces managed by the MCST which serve to
provide landscaping and communal facilities for residents in the
development are excluded from GFA.

Covered or enclosed features within these communal roof terraces are
included as GFA.

## Covered Communal Ground Gardens

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at
the 1^st^ storey. Such garden should flow seamlessly between the covered
and uncovered spaces of the 1^st^ storey and designed to be bright and
airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

-   Secondary C2G2

-   Predominant C2G2

All areas of the C2G2 shall be easily accessible to the public and/or
building users during normal opening hours for the development. The
communal ground garden shall not be enclosed and converted to any other
uses in the future. Covered ornamental pond/ reflective pool that forms
part of the communal landscape areas may also be considered as part of
the C2G2.

A landscape plan showing the proposed landscaping scheme and areas
within/beyond the 45-degree line shall be submitted as part of the
development application for assessment of the proposed C2G2.

## Secondary Covered Communal Ground Garden

Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey which are
shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above. These may be
excluded from GFA up to a maximum area defined by a 45-degree line taken
from the edge of the overhead projection. The communal landscaped areas
excluded from GFA within the 45-degree line must be unenclosed,
accessible and contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of
vegetation.

 
 

*Secondary C2G2 (view high-res illustration here)*

 
 

*Secondary C2G2 (Section)*

## Predominant C2G2

For Predominant C2G2, the additional covered areas beyond the 45-degree
line may be considered for exclusion from GFA if the spaces provide
substantial ground greenery with good spatial quality.

For on-ground greenery to qualify as a Predominant C2G2, it shall comply
with the following requirements:

-   The covered garden area should occupy at least 50% of the 1^st^
    storey building footprint;

-   Within the covered garden area, a minimum of 60% shall be lushly
    landscaped while the remaining 40% shall be set aside for meaningful
    communal gathering and activity spaces and unenclosed communal
    facilities. These spaces may include garden paths, playgrounds and
    covered ornamental pools.

-   Covered drop-off points may be considered as part of the C2G2 if
    well-integrated, paved with appropriate material and integrated with
    lush landscaping;

-   Both the covered and uncovered landscaped area shall include
    suitable varieties of plants which are planted in permanent and
    preferably sunken planting beds to enhance the spatial and visual
    quality of the space.

-   As the communal landscaped areas are intended to serve the public
    and/or building users, they shall be easily accessible to the public
    and/or building users during normal opening hours for the
    development^1^. They should also not be tucked away in dark/obscure

## Staircases

Staircases are included as GFA. The flight of the staircase is to be
projected upwards and be included as GFA on that particular floor.

 
 

*Staircases*

## Intermediate Staircase

Staircases at intermediate levels not connected to any floor are not
included as GFA.

 
 

*Intermediate Staircase -- Example 1*

 
 

*Intermediate Staircase -- Example 2*

## Scissors Staircase

Scissors staircase comprises two separate sets of staircases intertwined
within a single stairwell, with each set of staircase having its own
flight of steps. Each set of set staircase is included as GFA.

 
 

*Scissors Staircase*

## Staircase Connecting Virtual Floors

Staircase connecting between two floors with virtual levels in between
are included as GFA even if there is no access to the in-between the
virtual levels.

 
 

*Staircases Connecting Virtual Floors*

## Uncovered External Perforated Staircase

All uncovered external perforated staircases, regardless of materials,
are included as GFA.

For pure industrial/warehouse developments, uncovered external mild
steel perforated staircases are excluded from GFA provided the
development already provides a covered internal staircase to serve users
of the building. If the width of the uncovered external mild steel
perforated staircase (including the staircase landing) is more than
1.0m, the developer shall provide an undertaking not to cover up the
external staircase subsequently.

 
 

*Uncovered Staircase*

## Uncovered Staircase to ESS

Uncovered staircase to ESS are excluded from GFA.

## Structural Protrusion

Building features which are excluded from GFA can be allowed to extend
from the building wall line to serve different needs. These features are
typically short appendages and not extensive overhangs.

In situations where one building feature is added on to another, the
width of projection of these structures are measured from the building
wall line. If the proposed feature as measured from the wall line
exceeds the dimension prescribed for exclusion from GFA, it is to be
included as GFA as illustrated below.

The width of the projection of each item that is excluded from GFA
measured from the external building wall line cannot exceed the maximum
allowable width. Otherwise, the entire structure would be included as
GFA.
